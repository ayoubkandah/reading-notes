What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue? FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.

How can the server be assured a message was properly received? by sending message when the client connect

What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming? It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events". The stream nomenclature alludes to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events from the subject/stream-source.

How do you test an event driven system?

design tests at this level of scale, test practitioners need to have a good understanding of the dynamics of event-driven application architectures. Here’s how to design tests that ensure the various components within the architecture perform as expected at scale.

serverless functions are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies


AWS::Serverless::Api resource need not be explicitly added to a AWS Serverless Application Definition template. A resource of this type is implicitly created from the union of Api events defined on AWS::Serverless::Function resources defined in the template that do not refer to an AWS::Serverless::Api resource.
trigger is a SQL procedure that initiates an action (i.e., fires an action) when an event (INSERT, DELETE or UPDATE) occurs. Since triggers are event-driven specialized procedures, they are stored in and managed by the DBMS. 

The 5 Critical Differences Between DynamoDB vs MongoDB:

1-MongoDB is vendor agnostic, Open Source, and can be deployed anywhere. DynamoDB is only available on AWS.
2-DynamoDB is a fully managed AWS service, MongoDB can be self installed or fully managed with MongoDB Atlas.
3-DynamoDB as an integrated AWS service makes it easier to develop end to end solutions.
4-DynamoDB uses tables, items and attributes, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents.
5-DynamoDB supports limited data types and smaller item sizes; MongoDB supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

SQS  is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware, and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.

SNS is an online vehicle for creating relationships with other people who share an interest, background, or real relationship. Social networking service users create a profile with personal information and photos and form connections with other profiles.

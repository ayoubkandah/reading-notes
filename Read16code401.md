What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.

How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
by sending message when the client connect 

What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events". The stream nomenclature alludes to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events from the subject/stream-source. 

How do you test an event driven system?

design tests at this level of scale, test practitioners need to have a good understanding of the dynamics of event-driven application architectures. Here’s how to design tests that ensure the various components within the architecture perform as expected at scale.

server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".

The Publish/Subscribe pattern, also known as pub/sub, is an architectural design pattern that provides a framework for exchanging messages between publishers and subscribers. This pattern involves the publisher and the subscriber relying on a message broker that relays messages from the publisher to the subscribers.

Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.

Virtualization is the creation of virtual servers, infrastructures, devices and computing resources. Virtualization changes the hardware-software relations and is one of the foundational elements of cloud computing technology that helps utilize the capabilities of cloud computing to the full.

 EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

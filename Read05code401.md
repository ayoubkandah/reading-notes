A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
There are two types of Linked List :
1-Singly 
2-Doubly

Linked List :- data stracture that contains nodes that link to next node

Singly :- refer to number of ref, singly Linked list have only one ref . only next()

Doubly :- have double ref , next() and previous().

Node  :- have item/links that contain data for every link

Next :- refer to next node.

Head :- refer to type of first node linked list.

Current :- refer to currently node .
Big O :- The Big O of time and soace for Includes would be O(n) .

A node only knows about what data it contains, and who its neighbor is.

The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.
There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.

a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.

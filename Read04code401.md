ADV OF TDD :-
1. Better program design and higher code quality
4. Code flexibility and easier maintenance
3. TDD reduces the time required for project development

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
when we use implentation for a mock function

What is one downside of Test Driven Development?
slow process –

ES6 & ES5?
ES6 class basically does the work of defining a new object and appending functions to its prototype,
ES5 Function constructors work and look the same but the main difference is observed when the developer uses the Inheritance property.

Why Rest ?
REST is much easier than other approaches such as SOAP which keeps developers from having to reinvent the wheel as far as HTTP request operations go. SOAP also requires separate server and client programs.
Since REST is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" which avoids ambiguity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.
With REST, information that is produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

#Functional programming :- is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

#Object-oriented programming :- is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.

#ES6 :- Classes formalize the common JavaScript pattern of simulating class-like inheritance hierarchies using functions and prototypes.

#super :- The super keyword refers to the parent class. It is used to call the constructor of the parent class and to access the parent's properties and methods.

#this :- refer to Any  property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in non–strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.

#TDD :- Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.

#Jest :- is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase.

#Continuous Integration (CI) : is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

#REST :- is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services.

#Data Model :- is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database.

1- because we can use state globaly without using classes and in easy and flixible way


2-no, because the data wrape in childrens 

3- when we have to make a settings for a page

4- React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

Global states are used when components need to share states. React provides a very good and simple way to manage local state(React hooks) but when it comes to global state management the options available are overwhelming.

Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component: class App extends React.

provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Current Status: Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security. For most of these things, it will be a password. However, you may also want to list server rooms that are under lock and key. Physical security can be a vital part of data protection. Also, list the status of who has access to all of these programs and areas. This will give you a snapshot of your current data scenario.
Current Roles: Even if you do not have a formal roster and list of roles, determining what each individual team member does may only take a little discussion. Try to organize the team in such a way that it doesn’t stifle creativity and the current culture (if enjoyed).
Write a Policy: Any changes made need to be written for all current and future employees to see. Even with the use of a RBAC tool, a document clearly articulating your new system will help avoid potential issues.
Make Changes: Once the current security status and roles are understood (not to mention a policy is written), it’s time to make the changes.
Continually Adapt: It’s likely that the first iteration of RBAC will require some tweaking. Early on, you should evaluate your roles and security status frequently. Assess first, how well the creative/production process is working and secondly, how secure your process happens to be.

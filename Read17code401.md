What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing.

How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
by sending message when the client connect 

What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
It is mainly used for implementing distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software. In those systems, the subject is usually named a "stream of events" or "stream source of events", while the observers are called "sinks of events". The stream nomenclature alludes to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events from the subject/stream-source. 

How do you test an event driven system?

design tests at this level of scale, test practitioners need to have a good understanding of the dynamics of event-driven application architectures. Here’s how to design tests that ensure the various components within the architecture perform as expected at scale.

A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. 

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Cloud services are services available via a remote cloud computing server rather than an on-site server. These scalable solutions are managed by a third party and provide users with access to computing services such as analytics or networking via the internet.

 cloud architecture refers to the various building components that make up a cloud. The cloud, in this context, means a service often rented from a provider of computing power, storage, or business applications.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) as a secured cloud services platform that offers compute power, database storage, content delivery and various other functionalities. To be more specific, it is a large bundle of cloud based services. Consider we need electricity for our home. Either we can generate our own electricity or purchase it from electric power companies.

Heroku VS AWS
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Heroku are two commonly used cloud services that let us deploy, monitor, and scale web and mobile apps.

Both services provide us with cloud computing resources and are great for hosting applications.

But if you’re building your first mobile or web application, how can you decide which of these options – AWS or Heroku – is best for your application?

Choosing a hosting service becomes even harder when we take a glance at the number of products Amazon Web Services offer. It’s easy to get lost

 (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics. 

AWS Lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). Users of AWS Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

Use cases
What can you build with AWS Lambda? Learn more about the use cases below:
Data processing
You can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response to triggers such as changes in data, shifts in system state, or actions by users. Lambda can be directly triggered by AWS services such as S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis, SNS, and CloudWatch, can connect to existing EFS file systems, or it can be orchestrated into workflows by AWS Step Functions. This allows you to build a variety of real-time serverless data processing systems.
Real-time file processing
You can use Amazon S3 to trigger AWS Lambda to process data immediately after an upload. You can also connect to an existing Amazon EFS file system directly, which enables massively parallel shared access for large scale file processing. For example, you can use Lambda to thumbnail images, transcode videos, index files, process logs, validate content, and aggregate and filter data in real-time.
